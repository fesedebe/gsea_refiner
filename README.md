# gsea_refiner
 A tool for categorizing and interpreting pathway enrichment results using NLP techniques.

## Overview
 Pathway enrichment analysis often produces thousands of significant gene sets, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights. gsea_refiner applies keyword importance ranking, enrichment tests, and word embeddings (GloVe/BERT) to organize gene sets into biologically interpretable categories. It also generates visualizations summarizing pathway trends for RNA-seq datasets.
