# gsea_refiner
 A tool for categorizing and refining pathway enrichment results using statistical and NLP techniques.

## Overview
 Pathway enrichment analysis often produces thousands of significant gene sets, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights. gsea_refiner applies keyword importance ranking, enrichment tests, and word embeddings (GloVe/BERT) to organize gene sets into biologically interpretable categories. It also generates visualizations summarizing pathway trends for RNA-seq datasets. Itâ€™s a standalone tool & integratabtle with the LongTraC framework.

## Example Visualization
(Coming soon. Visualizations using public datasets will be added in upcoming releases.)
